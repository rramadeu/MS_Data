## Suplementary Table
Each cell represents the highest value of the statistics considering all methods for the given population. Between parentheses, which method gives such highest value. Cells in red, values above 0.90 threshold. Cells in blue, values above 0.80 threshold. 

### Keys: 
- dist: considered allele distribution which can be uniform (uni), triangular (tri), biallelic 1:3 (t13), biallelic 1:4 (t14), or biallelic 1:9 (t19).
- 2n: cytotype which can be 2n = 2x, 2n = 4x, 2n = 6x, 2n = 8x, 2n = 4x*, 2n = 6x*, or 2n = 8x*.
- loci: number of loci which can be 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 500, or 1000.
- al: number of alleles per locus which can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, or 20.
- RMSE (root mean square error) and IC (Interval of Confidence) of the relationships: PO: parent-offspring, FS: full-sib, HS: half-sib, GPGPO = granparent-grandoffspring, UN : uncle-nephew, GUGN : granduncle-grandnephew, UR : unrelated.
- CCC (concordance correlation coefficient):  for fenotypes from Farthing genealogy and genotypes from IACSP955000 genealogy.
- IC (interval of confidence) of the CCC statistic
(*)considers multivalent pairing. without (*) considers just bivalent pairing.
